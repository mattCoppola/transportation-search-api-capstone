# City â€¢ Mode | Thinkful API Capstone
## Project Description
This app provides a user the ability to quickly locate the nearest bikeshare stations and bustops around their current location.  They can also search for a specific address or landmark to see these transportation modes too.  Selecting a Marker Icon or Selection in the Listings tab will provide more information on the selected mode.

Along with Mapbox, this app uses two API's:  Transitland and Coord
* [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/ "Mapbox Homepage")

* [Coord](https://coord.co/ "Coord Homepage")
